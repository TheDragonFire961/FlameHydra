==Installers==
There are three installers stored here. Each perform different purposes. Once installed, only the upgrader can be used.
*index.php: the main installer.
*migrate.php: used to migrate from an existing comments solution
*update.php: repairs and/or upgrades RethCommentsring.
You'll need to pick the correct one if you want the install to work properly. Use index.php for most purposes, and
migrate.php if you need to migrate an existing installation. Use update.php if you already have a RethCommentsring
instance installed.
